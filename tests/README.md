# PyRPOD Test Inventory

This inventory documents every test asset in `tests/`: what it is for,
which subsystem and category it belongs to, how it is executed, and how
far its development has progressed.

**It deliberately records no pass/fail results.** Execution outcomes belong
to a specific run and are published in the pytest HTML report
(`reports/pyrpod-pytest-report.html`); development status is long-lived
metadata that a green test run does not change.

Test files follow the `<subsystem>_<category>_test_NN.py` naming convention,
and `tests/conftest.py` uses it to tag every collected test with a subsystem
marker (`logging`, `mdao`, `mission`, `plume`, `rpod`, `tooling`) and a
category marker (`unit`, `integration`, `verification`).

Regenerate this file and the HTML report with:

Run directly from the repository root; they are **not** pytest tests and
never appear in the HTML execution report. Most reproduce a published
figure and write a PNG under `tests/plume/output/`.

## Placeholder tests

Collected by pytest but containing no assertion or verification behavior -
typically an empty body or a fully commented-out one. Each is explicitly
skipped in its source file so that the HTML report shows it as **skipped**
rather than passed; a placeholder must never be mistaken for coverage.

| Test file | Subsystem | Category | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`mdao_unit_test_01.py`](mdao/mdao_unit_test_01.py) | mdao | unit | Placeholder MDAO unit test; the test body returns immediately and asserts nothing. |
| [`mdao_unit_test_02.py`](mdao/mdao_unit_test_02.py) | mdao | unit | Intended to build an array of cant-angle-swept thruster configurations (symmetric pitch/yaw canting) and visualize each sweep step. The entire body is currently commented out, so the test asserts nothing. |
| [`mdao_integration_test_01.py`](mdao/mdao_integration_test_01.py) | mdao | integration | Placeholder MDAO integration test; the test body returns immediately and asserts nothing. |
| [`mdao_verification_test_04.py`](mdao/mdao_verification_test_04.py) | mdao | verification | Intended variable-sweep study of the maximum overshoot velocity a logistics module can absorb with a fixed thruster configuration and deceleration start distance. The entire body is commented out, so the test asserts nothing. |
| [`mdao_verification_test_05.py`](mdao/mdao_verification_test_05.py) | mdao | verification | Intended trade study sweeping the surface cant angle of the RCS pack. The entire body is commented out, so the test asserts nothing. |
| [`mdao_verification_test_06.py`](mdao/mdao_verification_test_06.py) | mdao | verification | Intended multi-variable trade study sweeping axial overshoot together with surface cant angle. The entire body is commented out, so the test asserts nothing. |
| [`mission_unit_test_01.py`](mission/mission_unit_test_01.py) | mission | unit | Placeholder mission unit test; the test body returns immediately and asserts nothing. |
| [`mission_integration_test_02.py`](mission/mission_integration_test_02.py) | mission | integration | Intended to calculate the 6DOF performance of thruster working groups. The body only assigns mass-distribution constants; the header records that the analysis was disabled because it created unwanted data files, so the test asserts nothing. |
| [`mission_verification_test_01.py`](mission/mission_verification_test_01.py) | mission | verification | Placeholder mission verification test; the test body returns immediately and asserts nothing. |
| [`plume_unit_test_01.py`](plume/plume_unit_test_01.py) | plume | unit | Placeholder plume unit test; the test body returns immediately and asserts nothing. |
| [`plume_integration_test_01.py`](plume/plume_integration_test_01.py) | plume | integration | Placeholder plume integration test; the test body returns immediately and asserts nothing. |
| [`plume_verification_test_01.py`](plume/plume_verification_test_01.py) | plume | verification | Intended to plot simple isentropic radial-expansion profiles. Both plotting calls are commented out, leaving only construction of an IsentropicExpansion object, so the test asserts nothing. |

## Ignored or blocked tests

Excluded from pytest collection (see `collect_ignore` in
[`conftest.py`](conftest.py)) or otherwise unable to run.

## Legend

Three independent axes. A test can be `implemented` and still fail today;
a `placeholder` can be green in CI only because it is skipped.

**Execution outcome** — owned by pytest, one value per run, published only
in `reports/pyrpod-pytest-report.html`:

| Outcome | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| passed | The test ran and every assertion held. |
| failed | The test ran and an assertion or the code under test failed. |
| error | The test could not run to completion (setup or teardown raised). |
| skipped | The test was not executed (placeholder, or a skip condition). |

**Development status** — maintained in `test_manifest.yaml`, long-lived:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `implemented` | Complete: exercises the code and asserts a result. |
| `placeholder` | No assertion or verification behavior yet; skipped. |
| `needs_review` | Runs real code but asserts nothing, or its purpose is insufficiently documented. |
| `blocked` | Cannot run against the current architecture. |
| `archived` | Superseded; kept for historical reference only. |
| `deprecated` | Slated for removal. |

**Collection status** — whether pytest picks the file up:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `collected` | Collected and run by pytest; appears in the HTML report. |
| `manual` | Run by hand; defines no pytest tests. |
| `ignored` | Listed in `collect_ignore` in `conftest.py`. |
| `archived` | Under `tests/old/`, excluded from collection wholesale. |
