class TargetVehicle(Vehicle):
    """
        Class responsible for handling visiting vehicle data.

        Includes surface mesh and thruster configuration data.

        Attributes
        ----------
        Includes attributes defined in parent class "Vehicle".

        path_to_stl : str
            file location for Vehicle's surface mesh using an STL file.

        mesh : stl.mesh.Mesh
            Contains surface mesh using data read from STL file.

        Methods
        -------
        set_stl()
            Read in thruster configuration data from the provided file path.

        set_stl_elements()
            Read in thruster configuration data from the provided file path.

            Parameters
            ----------
            path_to_stl : str
                file location for Vehicle's surface mesh using an STL file.

            -------
            Method doesn't currently return anything. Simply sets class members as needed.
            Does the method need to return a status message? or pass similar data?
