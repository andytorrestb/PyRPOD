"""
Geometry utilities for RPOD visualization and mesh composition.

Responsibilities:
- Build visiting vehicle (VV) mesh for a given firing pose
- Compose cluster and thruster plume meshes
- Provide simple transform pipelines (rotate/translate order)

Note: This module should not perform file I/O; writing belongs in rpod.io.
